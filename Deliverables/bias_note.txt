The Titanic dataset is not fully representative of real-world populations. 
It reflects a specific early 20th-century passenger group, strongly shaped by class and gender. 
Survival patterns were influenced by the “women and children first” policy, making gender a key predictor. 
Wealthier, first-class passengers had better survival chances than third-class passengers, 
introducing socioeconomic bias. Moreover, many records (like Cabin) are missing, limiting spatial insights. 
This makes the dataset useful for machine learning education but not for drawing general conclusions 
about disaster survival in modern contexts.
